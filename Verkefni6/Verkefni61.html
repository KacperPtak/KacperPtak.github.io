                    We knew an Audi SQ2 was coming. It was logical
                    that Audi would crown its smallest crossover’s 
                    range with a go-fast, look-at-my-four-exhaust-pipes 
                    flagship.But we didn’t think it would be this fast.
                    The new Audi SQ2 is, as it turns out, a bit of a closet
                    rocketship. he SQ2 uses the VW Group’s ubiquitous 2.0-litre
                    turbocharged four-cylinder engine, but instead of 
                    bowing in in Golf GTI tune (242bhp), it’s working at
                    a full-fat 296bhp and 295lb ft – the same muscle as
                    the VW Golf R. Or, indeed, Audi S3. No wonder it’s quick.

            <main class="sr"><h4 class="margines3">New Lamborghini Aventador SJV!</h4>
            <p class="margines3">
                    This is the new Lamborghini Aventador SVJ, the most extreme
                    version of Lambo’s big-boy supercar yet. It’s a car we already
                    know to some degree – it’s already claimed the Nürburgring Nordschleife 
                    record, and we’ve also driven it – but this is our first glimpse of the SVJ
                    without any confuddling camouflage. As is the way, much of its design has
                    been led by aerodynamics, with a new version of Lambo’s ‘ALA’ active aero
                    tech. As a result, the SVJ hikes up downforce by 40 per cent over the old
                    Aventador SV, but with a much higher proportion at the front of the car 
                    to make the handling much sweeter. Indeed, it proved a lot more
                    confidence-inspiring when we drove it, with the addition of four-wheel
                    steering also assisting.<br>
