                   essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release
                    of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently
                     with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions

            There is quite a lot to the CSS Grid Specification, 
            however you don’t have to learn the whole thing at once. 
            I’ve gathered some of my resources here as a getting started guide.
            Start with the first few links, then check out the other sections

            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
            industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text 
            ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
            and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not 
            only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
            remaining essentially unchanged.
