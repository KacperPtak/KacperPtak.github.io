        <p class="margines">
                We knew an Audi SQ2 was coming. It was logical
                that Audi would crown its smallest crossover’s 
                range with a go-fast, look-at-my-four-exhaust-pipes 
                flagship.But we didn’t think it would be this fast.
                The new Audi SQ2 is, as it turns out, a bit of a closet
                rocketship. he SQ2 uses the VW Group’s ubiquitous 2.0-litre
                turbocharged four-cylinder engine, but instead of 
                bowing in in Golf GTI tune (242bhp), it’s working at
                a full-fat 296bhp and 295lb ft – the same muscle as
                the VW Golf R. Or, indeed, Audi S3. No wonder it’s quick.

        <main class="sr"><h4 class="margines3">New Lamborghini Aventador SJV!<br>
        <p class="margines3">
                This is the new Lamborghini Aventador SVJ, the most extreme
                version of Lambo’s big-boy supercar yet. It’s a car we already
                know to some degree – it’s already claimed the Nürburgring Nordschleife 
                record, and we’ve also driven it – but this is our first glimpse of the SVJ
                without any confuddling camouflage. As is the way, much of its design has
                been led by aerodynamics, with a new version of Lambo’s ‘ALA’ active aero
                tech. As a result, the SVJ hikes up downforce by 40 per cent over the old
                Aventador SV, but with a much higher proportion at the front of the car 
                to make the handling much sweeter. Indeed, it proved a lot more
                confidence-inspiring when we drove it, with the addition of four-wheel
                steering also assisting.<br>

                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing 
                    and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                     industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
                     when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled
                      it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five
                       centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining 
                       essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release
                        of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently
                         with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
                          of Lorem Ipsum.
